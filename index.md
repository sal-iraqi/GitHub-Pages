### Coding Experience
My coding journey started out back in highschool on Java for AP Comp Sci. 
Ever since then, I have been interested in programming applications, and so I have picked up more programming languages along the way, 
including C, C++, C#, and ARM Assembly. I have also had some and continuing to build experience on game development using Unity. Through programming, I learned Einstein's quote figuratively and quite literally:
> "Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results."

With all these years of coding, I can sum up my daily schedule with this code snippet:
```
while(!onSchoolBreak)
{
    eat();
    code();
    work();
    // sleep();
}
```

### Little About Me
I have lived almost half of my life in the US. I lived the other half in the Middle East, Iraq and Syria. Outside of academics, my main hobbies are:
- Playing Music
- Tennis
- Working out
- Hiking
- Catching up on anime
- Listening to music (this is currently my [favorite song](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ))

For my life goals, I currently have (rather vaguely):
- [x] Graduate High School
- [x] Get into college
- [ ] Graduate undergrad college
- [ ] Work in the industry
- [ ] Go back and teach

It is still a work-in-progress, but it will get completed with time and effort.
